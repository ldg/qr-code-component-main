## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used CSS Grid to center the component image and pushed the attribution links to the bottom of the page.

```css
body {
	background-color: var(--slate300);
	display: grid;
	justify-content: center;
	align-items: center;
	height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

My plan is to continue working through the Learning Path projects
